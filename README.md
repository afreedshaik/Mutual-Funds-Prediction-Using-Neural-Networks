In this paper we proposed a mutual fund prediction model using neural network algorithm. This work makes use of the neural network algorithms and some innovative calculation strategies in order to get more accurate results and predictions. According earlier researches, artificial neural network gives better results as compared to the other algorithms. We chose artificial neural network for exploration of new variant. In this work we used feed-forward back propagation neural network and artificial neural network to predict the closing value of mutual funds and classified the outcome in terms of profit or loss. The better results are obtained by our proposed artificial neural network model and as the feed-forward backpropagation neural network is used, so the weights are updated after every epoch. We obtained 0.33 as RMSE value for BPNN4 model.
